## 📌 Project Roadmap  

| #  | Project                     | Core Concepts Covered          | Difficulty |
|----|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | **🧮 Calculator**           | Basic I/O, arithmetic ops      | Beginner   |
| 2  | **📏 Unit Converter**       | Functions, user input, logic   | Easy       |
| 3  | **📅 Calendar Application** | Loops, arrays, date logic      | Intermediate |
| 4  | **🏧 ATM Simulator**        | File I/O, menus, transactions  | Advanced   |
| 5  | **📚 Library Management**   | Full file-based "database"     | Expert     |
